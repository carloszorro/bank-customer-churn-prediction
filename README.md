# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction  

> Built supervised ML models to predict customer churn for Beta Bank, optimizing F1 score (≥0.59) and comparing with AUC-ROC.

✅ Español: Modelos de aprendizaje supervisado para predecir la deserción de clientes en Beta Bank, optimizando la métrica F1 y comparando con AUC-ROC.  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Sprint 10: Supervised Learning** module at TripleTen Latam.  
The challenge was to help **Beta Bank** reduce customer churn by predicting which clients are at risk of leaving.  
The goal was to build classification models with the **highest possible F1 score** (minimum threshold: 0.59), and compare performance with the **AUC-ROC metric**.

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed  
- Preprocessed client behavior and contract termination data.  
- Handled class imbalance using resampling techniques.  
- Trained and evaluated multiple supervised learning models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
- Compared models using **F1-score** and **AUC-ROC**.  
- Selected the best model to predict churn with business applicability.

## 📂 Dataset Description  
Dataset included historical customer data:  
- `customer_id`: unique identifier  
- `age`: customer age  
- `tenure`: number of months with the bank  
- `balance`: account balance  
- `products_number`: number of products used  
- `is_active_member`: customer activity status  
- `churn`: target variable (1 = left, 0 = stayed)

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (classification models, metrics)  
- Resampling techniques (e.g., upsampling/downsampling)  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Improved **F1-score above the 0.59 threshold**.  
- Compared model performance with **AUC-ROC** for deeper insights.  
- Delivered a model capable of identifying customers at risk of churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.
